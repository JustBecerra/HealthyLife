Healthy Life is a project I started because I don't like how most healthy lifestyle apps look or work, I feel they offer waay much than you need for too much money...not my style.

This app has three main features:

- Calorie Counter
- Meal plans
- Calendar to check what you ate each day

This is built using Vite, React, Typescript and Shadcn
